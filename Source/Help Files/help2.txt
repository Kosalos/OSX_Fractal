2 Color Window

Bright  : overall brightness of image
Enhance : biased brightness effect
Contrast: enhance color differences from neutral gray tones

Specular : add spotlight lighting effect
  Light Position: move the spotlght
  SPower : set spotlight power
  SMix : set relative lighting, spotlight vs. coloring effects
  
Style : Select coloring style 0 ... 7

Second Surface -------------------------------

When value is zero (set to lowest value), the image renders as normal.
When active (non-zero, specifying distance to move along ray),
the Distance Estimation equation does not return the first fractal
surface encountered, but instead continues to move along the ray
to search for the second surface.
Allows you to see 'inside' many fractal shapes.

Reflect1 and Reflect2 control the second surface depth and strength

Mix X,Y,Z : swap the RGB color values

C Normal : specify distance from parent position when selecting the
   positions of neighboring points when calculating the Normal vector.
   
Blur :
  Specify the Strength of the blurring effect,
  the distance from the camera where the blurring effect is centered,
  and how much the blurred pointd are darkened

Radial Symmetry :

When value is zero (set to lowest value), the image renders as normal.
When active (non-zero, specifying pie wedge size in radians),
a pie slice shapged region of the image is repeated to form a mandala.
