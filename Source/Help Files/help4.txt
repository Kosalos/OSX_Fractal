4 Billboards

Press 'P' to launch the bitmap selection dialog,
then use billbords to specify where portions of the bitmap are displayed within
the fractal image

10 billboards are available

X,Y : set the position of the upper left corner of the billboard
Z   : set the dustance from the camera

XS,YS : set the size of the billboard

All the billboards get their image data from the single bitmap loaded earlier

U1,V1 : specify the relative position of the upper left coordinate
        of the billboard as 0 ... 1
U2,V2 : the same for the lower right coordinate

Fud:  experimental attempt to correctly position the billboard depth within the fractal image
