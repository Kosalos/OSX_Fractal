Lights Window

Three light sources are provided.

Set <Bright> to zero (full left on widget) to skip a light source.

<Spread> controls the "spot light" vs. "diffuse" characteristic.

All of these algorithms are 'escape-time Fractals',
and by tracking certain variables as the escape is determined
we learn information that can be used to enhance the fractal coloring.

Cycles:     how many times the trap controls are repeated
Strength:   relative brightness of trap coloring, from 0% to 100%
x Color:    assign Color to channel 'x' (252 colors)
x Weight:   specify how much channel 'x' adds to color, from -3 to +3

... the same 2 widgets for channels 'y' - 'r'

Fixed Trap has three values:
0: Orbit Trap calculated from ray point position
1: Orbit Trap calculated using distance of point from fixed point
2: fixed point is a relative distance from first ray point position

Press <L> to cycle keyboard focus between the windows.
